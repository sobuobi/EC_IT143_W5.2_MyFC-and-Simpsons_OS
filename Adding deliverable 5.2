-- Q1:(Scott Martinez) We wish to promote our global products.
-- We are interested in knowing how many non-US works are in our catalogue.

-- Please only give consideration to non-US products.

-- A1: The list of production nations (apart from the US) along with the total number of movie and television show titles is the response.

SELECT production_countries
	 , COUNT(Title) AS Total_Titles
     , type
FROM Netflix_titles
WHERE production_countries NOT LIKE '%US%'
GROUP BY production_countries, type
ORDER BY production_countries;
